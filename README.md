<h1>Hello there! 👋</h1>
My name is Omar Mahmood, and I am a recent graduate from Guru Nanak Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA). During my time in college, I developed a strong passion for coding and software development, which led me to work on several exciting projects.
<br>
One of my most notable projects was developing a college management system using Django, which helped streamline various administrative tasks and improve communication between students, teachers, and administrators.

Currently, I am working on building an ecommerce application using the MERN stack. This project has allowed me to dive deeper into web development and gain a better understanding of how to create scalable and robust web applications. Think Amazon, but with more cat videos. Because let's face it, who doesn't love a good cat video?

In all seriousness, I'm passionate about continuing to grow and learn as a software developer, and I'm excited to collaborate with others to create innovative solutions. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:omarmahmood005@gmail.com">omarmahmood005@gmail.com</a> or check out my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-mahmood-05/">Omar Mahmood - LinkedIn</a> if you'd like to connect or chat more about coding and tech!
